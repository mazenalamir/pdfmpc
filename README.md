# pdfmpc

pdfmpc is a short name for **parameterized derivative free model predictive control**. This is a Matlab package (with Matlab Coder use option) that enables to solve Nonlinear Model Preditive Control Design problem using Direct Single shooting highly parametrizable way. 

The pdf manual should be quite sufficient to use the package efficiently.
